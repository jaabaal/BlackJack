# BlackJack
A simple simulation of the Blackjack or Twenty-One game which is assigned as a Milestone project in the Python course by Jose Portilla. It consists of a dealer and a single player at the moment but can easily be extending to a multi-player game. I have made use of the OOP paradigm to code. It has been written in **Python 3**. 

It consists of the following classes:
1. Card
2. Deck
3. Dealer
4. Player
5. Table
